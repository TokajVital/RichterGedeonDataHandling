# Richter Gedeon Data Handling

Problem: How can we produce positive health outcomes by accessing and using personally identifiable sensitive health data at scale, while avoiding user concerns, hacking risks and compliance breaches in new, better ways? How could we gain usersâ€™ trust with a straightforward opt-in process that establishes mutual trust? How can we manage data with different processes ensuring compliance? How can we collect health insight without creating a target for hackers?

Solution proposal:
1. option: Distributed Database Architecture for GDPR
2. option: Federated learning
3. option: Storing medical data with block chain technology
